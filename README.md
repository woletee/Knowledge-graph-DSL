# Knowledge Graph Construction for ARC Tasks

This repository contains Python code for constructing knowledge graphs from ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) task grids. The project utilizes graph-based data structures to analyze and visualize relationships within ARC tasks, facilitating a deeper understanding of spatial and relational patterns.

## Features

- **Node Representation**: Utilize `Pnode`, `Onode`, `Gnode`, and `Vnode` classes to represent different layers of abstraction within ARC tasks.
- **Graph Construction**: Build and manipulate graph structures from task data.
- **Visualization**: Dynamically visualize knowledge graphs with color-coded nodes and edges.
## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- **matplotlib**:
- **numpy**:
- **scikit-learn**:
- **pandas**:
