#Knowledge Graph Construction for ARC Tasks

This repository contains Python code for constructing knowledge graphs from ARC (Abstraction and reasoning corpus) task grids. The project utilizes graph-based data structures to analyze and visualize relationships within ARC tasks, facilitating a deeper understanding of spatial and relational patterns.


##Features
Node Representation: Utilize Pnode, Onode, Gnode, and Vnode classes to represent different layers of abstraction within ARC tasks.
Graph Construction: Build and manipulate graph structures from task data.
Visualization: Dynamically visualize knowledge graphs with color-coded nodes and edges.
